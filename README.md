This Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a simple Python project that simulates the classic game. The program uses a dictionary to map the player's and computer's choices ("rock," "paper," or "scissor") to numerical values, enabling easy comparison of outcomes. The computer makes a random choice using the random module, while the user inputs their choice via the console.
The game evaluates the results based on standard rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. It announces the choices, determines the winner, and handles invalid inputs gracefully. 
This project demonstrates Python fundamentals like conditionals, user input, and randomness.
